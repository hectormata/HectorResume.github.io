                    were scripts primarily wrote on VBA and secondarily Python. That include complex
                    logic and Object Oriented Programming skills. In one instance I simplify a report that was performing about
                    700 - 2000 iterations -depending on the type of report (daily, weekly, monthly)- to about 10 iterations
                    using a binary search algorithm.

                    In this roles, I was faced with the challenge of learning a new language. Learning Lotus Notes framework
                    initially was tough because it was new compared to anything I had done before. I was able to overcome my learning curve quickly
                    due to my ability to identify patterns, allowing me to see the similarities with Visual Basic for Application
                    helped expedite my learning process and set me up to work on software and application enhancements.
                    One of my projects was to come up with a way to update multiple options inside a contract that were in our database to increase efficiency.
                    As a second part, my goal was to improve efficiency of updates by doing N number of updates to do a bulk update.

                    This role was heavily customer services and sales oriented. I excelled in the sales aspect of the role by providing
                    honest, trustworthy, and amazing customer service to make the customer comfortable during the whole process. Constantly
