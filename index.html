                    Primarily in charge of automating existing reports to improve efficiency and save the
                    department money. In the year I was there about 10 reports were automated, helped the department saved
                    enough work hours equivalent to a full-time employee salary making 60K. The reports that I helped automated
                    were scripts primarily wrote on VBA and secondarily Python. That include complex
                    logic and Object Oriented Programming skills. In one instance I simplify a report that was performing about
                    700 - 2000 iterations -depending on the type of report (daily, weekly, monthly)- to about 10 iterations
                    using a binary search algorithm.

                    In this roles, I was faced with the challenge of learning a new language. Learning Lotus Notes framework
                    initially was tough because it was new compared to anything I had done before. I was able to overcome my learning curve quickly
                    due to my ability to identify patterns, allowing me to see the similarities with Visual Basic for Application
                    helped expedite my learning process and set me up to work on software and application enhancements.
                    One of my projects was to come up with a way to update multiple options inside a contract that were in our database to increase efficiency.
                    As a second part, my goal was to improve efficiency of updates by doing N number of updates to do a bulk update.

                    Provided excellent customer service and committed to show a great work ethic and outperformed others.
                    Due to my ability to work hard and be a top performer I was given more responsibilities than the average intern had.
                    This role was heavily customer services and sales oriented. I excelled in the sales aspect of the role by providing
                    honest, trustworthy, and amazing customer service to make the customer comfortable during the whole process. Constantly
                    received performance awards on my sales numbers, by coming on tops of other interns, Management Trainees, Management Assistants,
                    and even Assistant Managers and Managers.
